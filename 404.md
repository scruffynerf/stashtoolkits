# stashtoolkits
Beta Code and other useful bits and pieces that aren't quite ready for the Community Repo

This repo has absolutely NO support (I might do it anyway), and if you use code from here, you take full responsibility for any results.

ToolKits include:

Movies - For Movie stuff related to Stash.

CodeSnippets - For various code I don't want to lose track of...

Utilities - Actual tools and tweaks and so on...

Acquisition - Rule #2 - Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.
